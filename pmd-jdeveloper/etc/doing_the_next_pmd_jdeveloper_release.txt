2) Can you run it it on a file and find some unused code?
3) Are options persistant?

cd ~/data/pmd/
cvs -q rtag -D tomorrow "pmd_jdeveloper_release_0_7" pmd-jdeveloper
rm -rf ~/tmp/pmd-jdeveloper
mkdir -p ~/tmp/pmd-jdeveloper
cvs -q export -d tmp -r pmd_jdeveloper_release_0_7 pmd-jdeveloper
mv tmp/* ~/tmp/pmd-jdeveloper
rmdir tmp/
